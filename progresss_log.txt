14.3.2020.
Every class that is shown here is new from this week. I created a simple GUI for testing things
I also implemented simple TXT and CSV readers, which handle correctly formatted data (Exceptions will be handled later)
Next week I'll spend on making the settings functional, and work on the plot itself to add the regression line too.
I spent roughly 10 hours this week on my features, and I think I'm doing well with my schedule, maybe a bit ahead of it.
