14.3.2020.
I added FileReader classes, Created a simple GUI for testing features.
I also implemented simple (not yet functional) ScatterChart for plotting the points
Next week I'll spend on adding JSON file type, making the settings functional, and work on the plot itself.
I spent roughly 10 hours this week on my features, and I think I'm doing well with my schedule, maybe a bit ahead of it.
