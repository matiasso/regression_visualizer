Every class that is shown here is new from this week. I created a simple GUI for testing things
I also implemented simple TXT and CSV readers, which handle correctly formatted data (Exceptions will be handled later)
Next week I'll spend on making the settings functional, and work on the plot itself to add the regression line too.
I spent roughly 10 hours this week on my features, and I think I'm doing well with my schedule, maybe a bit ahead of it.

I spent roughly 15 hours this week. I implemented functioning regression lines for both linear and exponential model
I added R squared value, and the function text visible also and they seem to be matching with Excel's regressionlines.
I added options for the user to specify lower and upper bounds for both X and Y-axis.
I created a few warning dialogs in case errors happen when reading files.
Most of the settings are already functional, but what seems to be the hardest part is changing the scatterchart symbols
I can use a .css file to change them, but I haven't found a way (YET) for how to change them during runtime.
Next week I'll add more dialogwindows for my settings and work on exceptions and errors and test what could go wrong.
I am now for sure ahead of my schedule, which is of course a good thing.

I quickly icluded the option to change graph point colors, but will be working on making it better
I will also add the option to change the icons, and make things better organized.
Next week I'll clean my code and test the existing features more.

I have worked a lot on my program and it's starting to look pretty nice. I have spent roughly 20 hours during the past two weeks.
I managed to make the symbols and their sizes and colors customizable. That took a lot of time due to some weird errors issues with the CSS
I also fixed a few bugs, made automatic checks for X;Y and Y;X formats so the data can't contain duplicate X-values in either format.
Oh and I also added an option to save the plots as PNG images. That wasn't too hard.
There's also more message dialogs and both the Y and X axis now scale up better than before.
I will spend the last weeks on making unit tests, and trying to break my program on purpose.
Currently I know that large datafiles (for example 30 000 data points) will freeze my program for some time.
I tried to search for solutions but it seems like there's no "easy fix" available. I might just add a progress bar to show how long it'll take
Only new feature that I thought of is a dark mode for my program. I'm not sure if I have time for that, but we'll see.
